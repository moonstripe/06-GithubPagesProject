        <p>The Marmot is an adorably chubby, well-furred, high-altitude rodent. I saw one once as I was backpacking in Desolation Wilderness near Lake Tahoe.</p>
        <p>It looked at my group of friends as it was eating as small berry. Instantly, I knew it was my favorite mammal, as well as the brand of jacket I was wearing at the time.</p>
